## Exercises

The expected solution is the "naive" approach which basically consist of decomposing the problem by following the problem instructions. Even though the problem is not complex, we expect the developer to write efficient code and tests (unit tests and property-based tests).

Another approach can be found by analysing deeper the raising patterns of the problem but we do not necessarily expect the candidate to develop it.

### 1. FizzBuzz

Given a range of positive numbers from `1` to `n`, we expect the following rule to be applied:

- if the number can be divided by 3, we write `Fizz`
- if the number can be divided by 5, we write `Buzz`
- if the number can be divided by 3 and 5, we write `FizzBuzz`
- else we write the number

Examples:

For `n` = `5`, we expect the following output: `1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz`
For `n` = `15`, we expect the following output: `1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz`
